##### Description
A proxy for taking data from overland, dumping it into an S3 bucket, then pushing the last point over to Ice Condorâ„¢

![rough arch diagram](9xWX.png "The Condor Takes Flight")

##### Details

The code takes in a geojson array of location points and writes each point to a file in s3.  It namespaces by year, month then day.  For instance, a point recorded on 2019-01-01T12:34:56Z would be placed as follows:

2019/01/01/Feature-2019-01-01T12:34:56.json

(Feature is a point type coming out of Overland) 

##### Configuration

You'll need an s3 bucket your lambda has rights to write to, and an Ice Condor key.  Shove those into the lambda configuration in the `bucket` and `ic_token` env vars respectively.

##### Deployment 

First you have to zip up your artifact-

`zip -r func.zip *`

Then update the lambda code (create on the first one):

`aws lambda update-function-code --function-name myFunctionName --zip-file fileb://func.zip --profile appropriate-profile`

Each lambda in this repo is handled separately.
